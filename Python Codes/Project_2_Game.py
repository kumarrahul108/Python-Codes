    Generate any Random Number and make it guess by the user until user guesses it Right.
                   Also , print in how many guesses user gussed it Right. 
                   
                   If user enters a number higher than the random number --> print : Too High
                   If user enters a number lower than the random number --> print : Too Low 
                   
                   Store guesses in a text file "highscore"
